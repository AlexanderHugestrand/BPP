# BPP
Better preprocessor, inspired by the C/C++ preprocessor, and taken a few steps further.

## Background
As a C++ developer by heart, the idea to this project came out of pure frustration over how "almost there, but not quite" C++ is. The problems become evident when you try to implement features not built in into the language, like reflection (as in Java).

What the C/C++ preprocessor is, in combination with C++ templates, is a limited scripting language run in compile time to generate code on the fly. BPP's aim is to become a potent and turing complete code generation language.
